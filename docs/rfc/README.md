1. Fork the repo.
2. Make a new branch, for instance `rfc/new-gamemode`.

4. Write your RFC.
5. Push your branch.
6. Open a merge request, wait for comments, update if necessary.
7. After the RFC is accepted, an issue will be opened to track the progress of its implementation. The RFC index will be updated to show the issue.
